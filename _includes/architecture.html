                    Phalanx
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Phalanx is the storage engine component of Olympus. It offers storage services to clients through an unified object, block and file interface. Virtual machines, containers, applications and users access data either locally or through a shared network. Phalanx is designed and optimized for modern software-defined environments and next generation storage devices. Phalanx's novel row/column architecture, device-aware design and log structured data layout minimize IO contention and latency while preventing hot write areas. Phalanx can also be easily containerized and deployed using existing orchestration frameworks (e.g. Kubernetes).

            <p>
                Phalanx's request management layer intelligently prioritizes incoming requests, enabling clients to experience high throughput and low latency IO. A separate metadata store increases the scalability, efficiency and robustness of the system. In addition, the cloud connect technology enables clients to seamlessly utilize resources from multiple cloud providers.

            <br>

            <p>
                Phalanx implements a novel row/column architecture for device management. It is designed for scalability and performance - adding a device scales both performance and storage capacity of the system.

                <b>Log structured data layout</b>

            </div>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>
                Together with device-aware and log structured data layout, Phalanx minimizes Read/Write IO contention and evenly distributes write workload across capacity preventing hot write areas. Phalanx is also host SMR capable (implements strict sequential writing) and supports variable capacity devices.
