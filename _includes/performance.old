                    Every application workload is different and every business requirement unique. No single benchmark nor trace can capture the whole user experience. However, it is useful to profile IO performance and usage patterns before committing to a storage solution or configuration.

                    Above shows what happens when we write twenty 100MB files sequentially using 64KB record size. With ext4, the storage device executed approximately 287 seeks (12.59 avg seek/sec * 22.87 sec) to complete the write. In contrast, Phalanx wasted no device cycles on seeks and translated that efficency into a better overall throughput (MB/s) and latency (IOPS) for the user.

                    Apache Hadoop is a collection of open-source software utilities that facilitate using a network of many computers to solve problems involving massive amounts of data and computation. It provides a software framework for distributed storage and processing of big data using the MapReduce programming model. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop</a>

                    TestDFSIO is a benchmark tool included in Hadoop distributions which measures the peformance of a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) cluster to read and write data. It is intended to give an estimate of the amount of available IO bandwidth to process data.

                    Hadoop does not natively support next generation storage technologies such as Host Managed SMR, nor can it intelligently prioritize incoming IO requests. These deficiencies lead to higher TCO and inconsistent performances at scale. With Phalanx, Hadoop can transparently utilize Host Managed SMR devices without needing application or kernel changes. TestDFSIO benchmark results shows that not only can Phalanx help users deploy and utilize advanced storage technologies such as Host Managed SMR and intelligent IO queue management in large scale distributed data processing systems. Users no longer have to compromise on performance for increased storage density and lower TCO.

                    Ceph is a free-software storage platform, implements object storage on a single distributed computer cluster, and provides interfaces for object-, block- and file-level storage. Ceph aims primarily for completely distributed operation without a single point of failure, scalable to the exabyte level, and freely available.

                    Ceph Object Storage Daemon (OSD) bench is a benchmark tool that is included in Ceph distributions which measures the performance of a storage node to write data. It is intended to give an estimate of the amount of available write throughput in a particular storage node.

                    Rados bench is yet another benchmark tool included in Ceph distributions which measures the performance of a Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object Store (RADOS) cluster to store and retrieve objects. Rados bench tests writing and sequential/random reading of objects. It is designed to give an estimate on number of objects the storage cluster can store and retrieve per second.

Note that there is an order of magnitude difference between Phalanx and ext4/XFS. This is because Phalanx is designed to minimize device contentions and reduce hot write areas.

                    Ceph does not natively support Host Managed SMR devices nor is it designed to minimize device contentions and reduce hot write areas.
                    These result in scalability issues and long tail latencies. Phalanx can help Ceph to be storage optimized and future ready without requiring application or kernel changes. Designed for simplicity and peformance, Phalanx enables Ceph to scale performance with capacity. The OSD and Rados bench results show that not only does Phalanx achieve a higher read and write throughput. Performance variability is also reduced dramatically, resulting in more predictable and consistent performance at scale.

                    With four channels of memory, iMac Pro can now accommodate up to 256GB. So you can visualize, simulate, and render huge 3D models. Create multiple test environments for cross-platform development. And keep numerous apps open at the same time. It’s all powerful. For all the things you want to do.

                    All-in-one design. More creative freedom.
iMac Pro puts the power of a workstation behind a stunning Retina 5K display, in a sleek enclosure just 5 mm wide at its edge. With your whole system powered by a single cable, your workspace stays free of clutter. It’s a beautifully efficient design that lets you focus all your attention on what you’re creating — not what you’re creating with.
                    Olympus puts the power of next generation storage technologies at your finger tips. With an innovative It has the power to effortlessly handle multiple streams of ingress and egress data. 
                    Olympus is designed to perform. Olympus is not a panacea for every IT challenge. Nor can simple IO trace comparisons and benchmarks sufficiently capture and explain the unqiue advantages of Olympus and the whole user experience. Meanwhile, we invite you to connect with us to discuss your business requirements and see if Olympus is a good fit for your organization.
