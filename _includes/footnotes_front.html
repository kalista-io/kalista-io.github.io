                        Testing conducted by Kalista IO in August 2019 using preproduction Phalanx software with Linux kernel 4.18.0-25-generic, and Intel® Core™ i7-4771 CPU 3.50GHz with 16GiB DDR3 Synchronous 2400 MHz RAM, and Western Digital Ultrastar DC HC620 host managed SMR and Ultrastar DC HC530 CMR drives connected through SATA 3.2, 6.0 Gb/s interface. Tested with Flexible I/O tester (fio) version 3.14-11-g308a. Random write bench ran for 1800 seconds with 4KB block and 200GB file size, 64 concurrent threads each with queue depth of 1. Executed 3 times to capture average and standard deviation IOPS values.

Tested with Apache Hadoop version 3.2.0 in single node pseudodistributed mode with single block replica, and TestDFSIO version 1.8 on OpenJDK version 1.8.0_222. TestDFSIO read benchmark ran with 32 files, 16GB each for a 512GB dataset. Executed 3 times to capture average and standard deviation throughput values.
